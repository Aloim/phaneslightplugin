# PhanesLight

> ## v3.7.1, the plugin has its own repository
>
> **This repository is a plugin distribution source. It exists so that plugin marketplaces can find and serve PhanesLight, and it is built to be consumed through Claude Code's plugin system rather than by hand.** Add it as a marketplace and let the plugin manager install and update it for you. Nothing here is meant to be cloned, copied, or fetched into `.claude/commands/`: the `plugin/` tree is a plugin payload, not a prompt you install yourself, and the layout it uses (namespaced skills, plugin-registered hooks, templates resolved from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`) only works when the plugin manager is the thing loading it.
>
> **If you want the manual, single-file install, it is a different product at a different repository:** [`github.com/Aloim/phaneslight`](https://github.com/Aloim/phaneslight), where `phaneslight.md` is fetched into `.claude/commands/` the way it always was. Use that one if you would rather own the prompt file and your own hook entries.
>
> **The marketplace source moved here from `Aloim/phaneslight`, so re-add it. Your commands do not change.** v3.7.1 also changes two rules in the lineup: the haiku tier no longer writes code, and the reviewer reviews your plan before the run starts.
>
> **The project is PhanesLight, and the names moved with it.** `phanes.md` → `phaneslight.md`, `/phanes` → `/phaneslight:run`, `/phanesupgrade` → `/phaneslight:upgrade`, and project state moved from `.phanes/` to `.phaneslight/`.
>
> **PhanesLight now installs as a Claude Code plugin.** Add its marketplace and install it:
>
> ```
> /plugin marketplace add Aloim/phanesplugin
> /plugin install phaneslight@phaneslight
> ```
>
> **If you added the marketplace from `Aloim/phaneslight` before v3.7.1**, that repository no longer holds the plugin; it holds the manual prompt now. Remove the old marketplace and add the new one. The plugin itself is still named `phaneslight`, so `/phaneslight:run` and `/phaneslight:upgrade` are unchanged.
>
> Then restart Claude Code and run `/phaneslight:run`. The entry points are namespaced now: `/phaneslight:run` and `/phaneslight:upgrade`.
>
> **Why the move.** This plugin was built for the **Claude community marketplace**. Publishing it into `Aloim/phaneslight` at v3.7.0 replaced the manual prompt that lived there and retired the manual install path as a side effect, which was never the intent. Both halves are corrected at v3.7.1: the plugin has its own repository here, and `Aloim/phaneslight` is the manual, single-file PhanesLight again.
>
> **The manual install path is maintained again, separately**, at [`github.com/Aloim/phaneslight`](https://github.com/Aloim/phaneslight) as `phaneslight.md`. Pick one path and stay on it; running both leaves two live entry points at the same version with no documented precedence. To leave the plugin for the manual install, run `/plugin uninstall phaneslight@phaneslight` and `/plugin marketplace remove phaneslight`, then follow "Coming from the plugin" in that repository's README. If you are currently running both, install the plugin and then run `/phaneslight:upgrade`, which archives the old command files.
>
> **This repository, [`github.com/Aloim/phanesplugin`](https://github.com/Aloim/phanesplugin), is the plugin's home.** The manual prompt lives at [`github.com/Aloim/phaneslight`](https://github.com/Aloim/phaneslight). PhanesLight is a byproduct of a larger project, **Phanes**, a highly sophisticated agentic orchestration setup that is coming to the `Aloim/phanes` repository and inherits the Phanes name.
>
> **Prefer the pre-ladder workflow?** v3.6.0 replaced the review chain with an escalation ladder. The last release that works the other way is v3.4.1, available from the repository's tags.

**PhanesLight** is a bootstrap prompt for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). One command turns an empty or chaotic repository into a fully wired, opinionated, multi-agent development environment.

**It is a byproduct of a larger project called Phanes**, a highly sophisticated agentic orchestration setup, coming soon to [`github.com/Aloim/phanes`](https://github.com/Aloim/phanes). PhanesLight is the part of that work which turned out to be useful on its own: the bootstrap, the project memory and the discipline that keeps a team of agents honest, extracted into something one command installs into any repository. That provenance is why it is deliberately small. The two are separate products with separate install paths, and nothing you install here is affected when Phanes lands.

It is not install-once-and-forget. It is a living specification you re-run: each `/phaneslight:run` surveys the project again, upgrades the sub-agents, fills in missing infrastructure, and bumps a run counter. The result is an agentic team that grows with your codebase instead of rotting beside it.

**The prompt is one file.** It ships inside the plugin as the `/phaneslight:run` skill. The scripts, hooks, agents and documents it sets up are created inside your repository during the run: language-independent scripts and prompt templates are installed from the tested library the plugin ships with, everything else is generated. The install touches no network, so it cannot half-succeed on a bad connection.

**Run `/phaneslight:run` and `/phaneslight:upgrade` on Opus 5 at `high` effort** (`claude --model opus --effort high`). Those runs build and maintain the whole setup, so they are the ones worth spending on. The team they install is designed to run on Sonnet 5 afterwards, which is what keeps a Max 5x plan viable. See [Which model for which run](#which-model-for-which-run).

**Modular by design.** The core stays one file on purpose; anything beyond bootstrapping ships as a separate [companion tool](#companion-tools) that works standalone in any repository and snaps into PhanesLight's structures when it finds them.

| Your situation | What to use |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh project, or one with no PhanesLight yet | `/phaneslight:run`. Re-running it also keeps a current install up to date. |
| A project carrying an older PhanesLight or Phanes (any version) | `/phaneslight:upgrade`. Retires any manual install it finds, then upgrades the whole structure on a dedicated branch behind an evidence-verified checklist. Accumulated knowledge is preserved, never rewritten. |

## What it does

**1. Pre-flight.** The run checks itself first, comparing its own version stamp against the version recorded in your project and stopping to ask if the two disagree in a direction it should not resolve alone. There is no network probe; the plugin manager owns updates. It then installs the four MCP servers it benefits from, and only four, because every tool schema costs context in every session and each server has to remove more context than its schema costs:

- **`context7`** for live library documentation, on demand.
- **`deepwiki`** for digest answers about GitHub dependencies, so agents never pull dependency source into context.
- **`semble`** for hybrid code search, so an agent finds the exact snippet instead of grepping a module and reading whole files.
- **`serena`** for symbol-level navigation. **(v3.6.1)** Granted only where its language servers actually cover your stack; on a PowerShell, shell or Markdown project it degrades to file search that `semble` already does better, so it is skipped and the reason recorded.

These are enhancements, not dependencies: a failed install becomes a TODO and the run continues degraded. The pre-flight then detects your platform, runs a capability census probing each server for real reachability, and asks you once which capabilities it may build policy around. Nothing you installed is ever changed or removed. A ledger at `.phaneslight/run-progress` lets a session that dies or compacts mid-bootstrap resume from the last completed phase.

**2. Repository comprehension.** It reads the README, source tree, configs and CI to work out the project's purpose, primary language, build system and module boundaries, filtering out vendored dependencies, example packs and demo content.

**3. Project memory infrastructure.** The substrate every sub-agent works against:

- **`documentation/`** — session summaries, plans, dated architecture snapshots, and a curated API registry capturing what code search cannot see (deprecations, contracts beyond type signatures, anti-patterns). Every folder carries a **generated `_index.md`**, so agents find knowledge by descending indexes at a few hundred tokens a hop instead of scanning the tree. **(v3.6.1)** Indexes are ordered by filename rather than modification time, so a sequenced folder's newest entry is its first line and editing an old document no longer reorders the whole index. Files respect a 500-line soft ceiling.
- **`tests/`** — `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`, `fixtures/`, `helpers/`, with the same header-stamp discipline `src/` uses.
- **`.phaneslight/scripts/`** — the library that owns every mechanical rule: stamped file creation, line counts, documentation audit, index regeneration, hot-file character budgets, API baseline regeneration and diffing. Each script finds the project by walking up to `.phaneslight/config.json` and uses only root-relative paths, so a hook can never be wired to the wrong tree. **On Windows, ten more commands** mechanize what a run previously did by hand — `preflight`, `update-preflight`, `install-templates`, `scaffold`, `manifest-write`, `ledger`, `census-diff`, `hook-ledger-status`, `repo-manifest`, `batch-apply` — turning thirty to fifty tool calls into one digest and letting a re-run measure what moved before rebuilding. **Every one observes or writes what it is told to and decides nothing.** On POSIX they are refused by name rather than faked, and the manual flow is unchanged.
- **`.phaneslight/returns/`** — **(v3.6.1)** durable sub-agent returns, written before the next dispatch. See [Core principles](#core-principles-enforced-by-phaneslight).
- **Enforcement hooks** — registered by the plugin, not written into your `.claude/settings.json`, and enforcing rules at the harness layer: a blocking guard denying any unstamped new file, an advisory check running size and documentation audits on every write. Prompts forget under context pressure. Hooks cannot.

**4. Tiered workflows.** Every task is sorted into **T1** (single-file fix), **T2** (feature inside one module) or **T3** (cross-module). Each tier loads different context and engages a different chain, but **disclosure is universal**: even a T1 fix is named in a report, and closure reconciles what landed against what was intended at every close. Only the paper trail scales with tier. A task that outgrows its tier mid-flight stops and asks for promotion.

**5. The roster: five agents, always the same five,** named by model tier. Domain expertise is composed per task and injected into the spawn prompt rather than baked into an agent file, so the always-on context cost is fixed rather than growing with the project.

| Agent | Model | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<slug>-orchestrator` | Opus 5 | Authors, applies and dispatches. Main executor as well as orchestrator. |
| `<slug>-reviewer` | Fable 5.1 | HIGH and CRIT findings, **and the plan review at every planned launch (v3.7.1)**. Writes a fix plan and hands it back; never applies. Writes **plan files and review artifacts** and names every one; never code. |
| `<slug>-worker` | Sonnet 5 | The default working tier for authored code, within a dispatched scope, disclosing every edit. |
| `<slug>-mechanic` | Haiku 4.5 | Mechanical **non-code** transforms, doc indexing, archive condensation, fetch-and-digest retrieval. **Never writes code of any kind (v3.7.1)**, and escalates from LOW upward because it cannot fix anything itself. |
| `<slug>-closure` | Sonnet 5 | Independent re-derivation at every close. Writes no code; its output is a flag, never a fix. |

The expensive tier is affordable because it is rare: worker and mechanic escalate to whoever spawned them, the orchestrator handles MED itself, and only an undeferred HIGH or CRIT reaches Fable. **(v3.6.1)** A pinned model that is unreachable is retried with backoff, then substituted down a documented ladder with the substitution recorded, rather than halting its tier.

**6. Workflow codification.** YAML files in `.claude/workflows/` codify task *sequences*: what happens in what order, which scripts run when. Who spawns whom is fixed in the prompt, not per project. **(v3.6.1)** At least one workflow must cover **recurring maintenance** (backlog triage, conformance audit, snapshot refresh) rather than change-type work alone, with an explicit trigger and the understanding that finding nothing is a successful run.

**7. Bootstrap session summary.** `documentation/session-summaries/SS00001_phaneslight-bootstrap_<date>.md` records the install, module list, roster and deferred TODOs.

> **After the first run, restart your Claude Code session.** Hook configuration is snapshotted at session start, so the enforcement hooks arm on the next one.

### How the five work together

Where work enters depends on its size: a single task or a short plan is triaged and run directly; a plan of five steps or more engages `<slug>-orchestrator`, which walks the plan and holds the run's context so your own session does not.

Only two agents can spawn: the orchestrator and the reviewer. That is what
bounds the whole system to three levels, and it is why the picture below is
this shape rather than an open mesh.

**Work travels down with a brief. Findings travel up by severity.**

```

A worker spawned by the reviewer reports to the **reviewer**, not to the
orchestrator. Nobody reaches past the agent that dispatched them, and nobody is
ever forked: every spawn carries a self-contained brief rather than inheriting a
parent's context.

### What happens to a finding

Any agent can raise one. There is one ladder, and only the top three rungs
create work anywhere:

```text
   CRIT  ·  HIGH  ·  MED   ──►  create work
   LOW   ·  INFO           ──►  create none, ever. They stay in the report,
                                are never rehomed, never become follow-ups.

   -worker finds something MED or above
   -mechanic finds something LOW or above  (v3.7.1: it may not write

   -closure runs at every phase close, every T2/T3 step close, and before
   every handover. It re-derives rather than trusting, so it catches what
   nobody reported: an edit no one disclosed comes back as drift.
```

**This is the shape PhanesLight is built for.** It pays off most when you write a plan first, as numbered steps grouped into phases, each step with a clear boundary and each phase with an exit condition — that is what gives the orchestrator something to route. A vague sentence still works; it just gives the machinery less to hold onto.

Re-running `/phaneslight:run` detects the existing install through the `.claude/.phaneslight` marker and refreshes in place, measuring agents, workflows, scripts, hooks and READMEs against the latest spec and refreshing whatever drifted.

---

## Which model for which run

Two questions get confused. **Which model you launch the session on** changes per run. **Which model each generated agent runs on** is decided by PhanesLight and is not your dial. This is about the first.

| The run | Recommended model | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Install** — first `/phaneslight:run` in a project | **Opus 5**, or **Fable 5** if you can afford it | `high` |
| **Update** — re-running `/phaneslight:run` | **Opus 5**, or **Fable 5** if you can afford it | `high` |
| **Upgrade** — `/phaneslight:upgrade` | **Opus 5**, or **Fable 5** if you can afford it | `high` |
| **Everyday work** with the installed team | **Sonnet 5** (what makes Max 5x workable), or Opus 5 if budget allows. **Fable 5 for pre-planning only** | `high` |

```bash
claude --model opus   --effort high     # installing, updating, or upgrading
claude --model sonnet --effort high     # everyday work with the installed team
```

**The bootstrap runs hot because it is paid once.** `/phaneslight:run` and `/phaneslight:upgrade` are single-shot, judgment-dense runs that survey a repository, decide module boundaries and author a whole roster, and you live inside that output for weeks. Everyday execution is the opposite: a repeated cost, paid daily, multiplied by every agent in every chain, which is what Sonnet 5 at `high` is designed around.

**Fable 5 earns its price in daily use for pre-planning, and only pre-planning.** The plan is the highest-leverage thinking in the cycle, written once, inherited by every downstream agent. Drafting on Fable and executing on Sonnet is a good trade; a whole execution session on Fable is not.

**Effort is `high` everywhere and is not a dial.** It is fixed at session launch and governs the primary session and every sub-agent; `xhigh` is retired. Set it at launch, since changing it mid-session writes to your global settings and leaks into other projects and parallel sessions.

---

## How to use

### First run

Type `/phaneslight:run` in your project. Three things make it land well:

- **Start on Opus 5 at `high` effort** (`claude --model opus --effort high`). The first run decides your module boundaries and authors your whole roster, and you live inside that for weeks.
- **Give it something to read, ideally a plan.** On an empty repository, create at least a `plan.md` describing what you want to build, so the setup is shaped around the project you intend rather than an empty folder. **Numbered steps grouped into phases** is the shape the run is designed to consume.
- **Steer it.** Anything typed after the command is a directive that takes priority over defaults: `/phaneslight:run focus on the api/ module; skip pre-commit hook install`.

Restart your session when it finishes so the hooks arm.

### Re-running `/phaneslight:run`

Think of it as refreshing Claude's knowledge of your project. **Launch update runs on Opus 5 too** — they are deciding what your team looks like, not using it.

**A re-run measures before it rebuilds** (Windows). It opens by asking what actually moved: spec version, capability census, hook table, register, file hashes, git history since the last run. Nothing moved and a clean worktree means it verifies rather than regenerates, which makes a habitual re-run cheap enough to be habitual. Where it cannot see (no git, no recorded previous run) it does the full pass, because not knowing is not the same as nothing having changed.

- **Early, small project:** run it freely, several times a day.
- **Before an implementation plan** — the highest-value run of all. Write the plan, then run `/phaneslight:run` and paste the plan or its path after the command, so the team is tuned to execute exactly it.
- **Session bookends:** end of a workday, or first thing next morning.
- **Grown project:** once or twice a day, plus one before a large plan.

---

## Core principles enforced by PhanesLight

- **Procedure in scripts, judgment in prompts, hooks at the harness layer.** Any rule a script can enforce lives in `.phaneslight/scripts/`, and hooks make the critical ones unskippable: a blocking stamp guard, an advisory size check, and on Windows a session-start check that speaks only when a previous run died mid-flight. Mechanical rules in prompts get forgotten under context pressure. Scripts do not forget; hooks cannot be skipped.
- **Durable returns (v3.6.1).** Every sub-agent return is written to `.phaneslight/returns/` **before the next dispatch**, verbatim. Bounded fan-out governs how many agents run; nothing governed **durability**, and that was where runs lost their most expensive work: a return lives in exactly one place, the spawner's context, and that context has a ceiling it is guaranteed to reach. Three incidents cost 66 rows of reconstruction triage. Once the rule was explicit, the same run survived three consecutive API crashes with zero loss.
- **Model degradation is documented (v3.6.1).** "Fixed by role" governs the *choice*, not the *availability*. An unreachable pinned model is retried with backoff, then substituted down a per-role ladder, recorded in three places. The reviewer's ladder goes **up** (Fable → Opus): review is load-bearing and the wrong axis to economize on.
- **Verification is load-bearing, not polish (v3.6.1).** Worker dispositions are repeatedly overturned on review, and so occasionally is the orchestrator's own HIGH finding. That is the design working. Budget the review pass into the plan rather than the slack; worker output is not shippable as-received, and a pass that finds nothing is a successful pass, never grounds for skipping the next.
- **Single writer per artifact.** Every registry file, snapshot, summary and generated `_index.md` has exactly one writing agent. Many readers, one writer.
- **Write rights follow the lineup, and every edit is disclosed.** The orchestrator writes unrestricted; the worker only inside a dispatched scope, naming every edit; **the mechanic the same, but never code (v3.7.1)**; **the reviewer never writes code, and does write plan files and review artifacts, naming every one (v3.7.1)**; closure never writes code. An undisclosed edit is reported as drift.
- **No UI approval by prose.** A proposal declares its viewports and reference designs up front; after apply, closure captures and runs an explicit pass/fail checklist. "Looks good" is not evidence. Missing capture tooling is diagnosed, remembered, and marked visually unverified rather than passed silently.
- **Context injection over inheritance.** A sub-agent receives only the slice its tier allows and pulls bulky material through a mechanic digest. **(v3.6.1)** That digest is *unverified* material, not a source: any fact from one heading into a durable document is re-derived first, and counting tasks in particular are a false economy at that tier.
- **Bounded fan-out.** No more than 5 sub-agents at once, whatever the harness allows. A wider sweep is recommended to you, never quietly self-multiplied. Every session summary records the fan-out ledger.
- **Compaction survival.** A run keeps a phase ledger on disk and resumes from it after a mid-flight death, and re-reads the spec from disk the moment it can no longer see its exact text rather than executing a lossy summary of itself.
- **Index-first navigation.** No agent bulk-reads `documentation/`. It descends the indexes, loads the target, and reads nothing else.

## For inexperienced users: step-by-step from zero

Experienced Claude Code users can skip to [How to install](#how-to-install).

**1. Create a Claude account** at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai).

**2. Get a plan that can carry PhanesLight.** A single task can run chains of several Claude instances, each using part of your allowance. **Pro is not enough.** You need **Claude Max 5x** (workable entry point), **Claude Max 20x** (recommended headroom), or the **Claude API** pay-per-token at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) — bearing in mind multi-agent orchestration uses far more tokens than ordinary chat. Check current pricing on the official pages.

**3. Install Claude Code.**

```

With Node.js 18+ you can instead run `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. Install `git` too ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)); PhanesLight requires it. Verify with `claude --version`.

**4. Sign in.** Run `claude` in any project folder and follow the prompt, or type `/login`. Choose **Claude account** for Max, **Anthropic Console** for API.

**5. Install PhanesLight** — continue directly below. It is two commands.

## How to install

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), installed and authenticated.
- `git`, plus your project's own language toolchain.
- On **Windows, PowerShell 5.1+** (ships with Windows). This release is Windows-first; POSIX parity lands in a later version.
- Recommended: `uv`, which runs the `serena` and `semble` MCP servers. The first run offers to install everything it needs.

### Install the plugin

PhanesLight is distributed as a Claude Code plugin.

```
/plugin marketplace add Aloim/phanesplugin
/plugin install phaneslight@phaneslight
```

It is also listed on the community marketplace. That catalog syncs on its own schedule, so if the listing has propagated, this works too and installs exactly the same plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-community
/plugin install phaneslight@claude-community
```

Use the first pair if the second reports that the plugin cannot be found.

Then **restart Claude Code**. Plugin hooks are loaded at session start, so the enforcement hooks arm on the next session rather than the current one.

On that next session you will see:

> PhanesLight v3.7.0 installed. Run /phaneslight:run to update Project Memory.

### Run it

```
/phaneslight:run
```

Installing the plugin on its own does nothing to your project. `/phaneslight:run` is what surveys the repository, generates the agent roster, installs the scripts and writes the project memory. The first run takes several minutes, pauses to confirm module boundaries, and asks once whether to install the four recommended MCP servers.

The two entry points are:

| Command | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `/phaneslight:run` | Every setup and update run. |
| `/phaneslight:upgrade` | Migrating a project generated by an older PhanesLight, or adopting a manual pre-v3.7.0 install. |

### The manual install path is retired

Before v3.7.0, PhanesLight was installed by fetching `phaneslight.md` into `.claude/commands/`. That path is closed and the raw files are frozen at v3.6.2.

If you have a manual install, **run `/phaneslight:upgrade` after installing the plugin.** It reports both entry points and their versions, archives the manual command files rather than deleting them, and leaves the plugin as the single source. This matters: project commands and plugin skills both stay available, so leaving the old files in place gives you two live entry points at two different versions with no way to tell which one ran.

---

## Upgrading an older install

`/phaneslight:upgrade` ships with the plugin; there is nothing separate to install.

Run it when any of these is true:

- The project was generated by a PhanesLight below v3.5.0, or by pre-rename Phanes.
- `/phaneslight:run` stopped and told you a migration boundary was crossed.
- You are adopting a manual install, as above.

It migrates the project behind a generated, evidence-verified checklist, preserving accumulated knowledge, then hands back to `/phaneslight:run`. **Restart your session afterwards.**


## Companion tools

PhanesLight stays modular: capabilities beyond bootstrapping ship as **companion tools**. Each is a full standalone tool that works in any repository with no PhanesLight install, and each also cooperates with the structures PhanesLight generates.

- **[Charon](https://github.com/Aloim/charon)** — finds dead code, unused files and dependencies, and duplication, then writes an evidence-backed audit report without touching anything. In a PhanesLight project the report is filed into the documentation tree and dead exported APIs become proposed registry annotations. Worth running before large refactors: stale code is context poison for agents.
- **[Philia](https://github.com/Aloim/philia)** — shares a Windows terminal in the browser for collaborative or remote vibecoding: a password-protected link, shared tabs and a side chat, tunneled from your own PC with nothing for guests to install. The host keeps a kill switch and a live indicator.
- **[Mosyn](https://github.com/Aloim/mosyn)** — a shared, disciplined project memory on decentralized storage (Walrus and SEAL): recall before acting, decision and failure logging, schema-locked session distillation with an append-only audit trail. Alongside PhanesLight it gives the whole team one durable memory across sessions, machines and teammates.
- **[Metis](https://github.com/Aloim/metis)** — reads Claude Code's own run transcripts and reports whether your team actually used the tools and workflows it was told to, harvesting short-lived subagent transcripts before the harness discards them. In a PhanesLight project the census detects it and update runs act on its adherence report.

---

## Recommended third-party enhancements

PhanesLight never installs these. The census discovers them only if you installed them, and wires them into exactly the agents whose duties they serve, under least privilege, never as a hard dependency. **(v3.6.1)** The stack-match gate is now hard: a capability that cannot complete the sentence "granted because this project has ___" is not granted and not listed. All were verified actively maintained on 2026-07-15; re-check before adopting. Code search is absent because PhanesLight installs `semble` itself.

- **Shell-output compressors** (e.g. RTK) — a PreToolUse proxy stripping noise from build, test and git output before it reaches any agent's context, preserving errors and diffs in full. Measured at ~89% noise removal in July 2026. Helps every agent that runs shell commands; needs no wiring.
- **Usage monitors** (e.g. claude-hud, claude-monitor) — live context fill and rate-limit forecasting alongside long runs. Purely observational, zero token cost.
- **CLAUDE.md linters** (e.g. cclint) — validate the instruction files PhanesLight generates on the CI side, catching deprecated model identifiers, broken imports and leaked keys.

## Version

**Current: v3.7.0** (2026-09-03), the plugin release. PhanesLight installs as a Claude Code plugin, the entry points are `/phaneslight:run` and `/phaneslight:upgrade`, the enforcement hooks are registered by the plugin rather than written into your project's settings, version checking is local instead of a network fetch, and the four MCP servers are offered once rather than assumed. The manual install path is retired at v3.6.2. See the [Changelog](Changelog.md).

**Tooling:** `new-file` selects its header by *destination* rather than by a magic module name, so a Markdown file under `documentation/` gets the DOC discipline header whatever module was named, and says so rather than promoting silently. `doc-index` orders by filename instead of modification time, so the index can answer "which is the latest" and editing an old document stops reordering the whole file. `register-check` renames its completed-entry finding to `COMPLETED-NOT-ARCHIVED` and explains itself, resolving a contradiction where the register legend advertised a marker whose use the checker reported as a finding. `loc-check` always terminates with a count line, so a truncated tail carries the number. Closure's write surface is documented exhaustively, since "output is a flag, never a fix" is a claim about judgment, not about the file system.

**Orchestration:** durable returns, the documented degradation posture, the owner-owned `pinned:project` deviations block that survives regeneration, and a requirement that at least one workflow cover recurring maintenance rather than change-type work alone.

**Bootstrap and calibration:** a bootstrap snapshot may no longer state a bare negative — markers are phrased as unverified negatives with their method named, and the prose is searched before one is written. Mechanic digests are documented as unverified material requiring re-derivation before anything from them is written into a durable document. Serena is granted only where its language servers cover the stack.

Full accounting, and the complete release history from v2.1 onward, in [`Changelog.md`](Changelog.md). The last pre-ladder distribution is v3.4.1, available from the repository's tags (`git checkout v3.4.1`); it is no longer carried inside the release tree.

**Immediately beneath: v3.6.0** (2026-09-03) retired the review chain. The Critic pass on every diff, the two mandatory verdicts, the Reflect loop, the separate security gate, the Synthesizer, and the domain roster of six to ten personas were all replaced by a fixed five-agent lineup named by model tier and an escalation ladder in which findings travel **upward by severity** instead of artifacts travelling sideways through gates. This is a deliberate reduction in review coverage traded for token economy; what stands in its place is disclosure plus independent re-derivation at close. The retired machinery is preserved verbatim in the project's internal records.

Issues and pull requests are welcome at [`github.com/Aloim/phanesplugin`](https://github.com/Aloim/phanesplugin). A substantive change to `phaneslight.md` should explain which class of failure mode it closes, because PhanesLight is a defensive document and every clause is load-bearing.
